COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

There were some funky issues in your project here, Luke, although I think
there all fixed up now. There was a weird "/" in your .gitignore file 
(which maybe I'd seen in some other files?) and all the files had a
"copy" appended to the end of the file name--what's up with that?

I changed the filenames and it seems to work fine now!

SCORE: 19/20
